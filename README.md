# INTRO !!

hello! we are a system!! we dont go by one specific name, so pls just ask who is front (note: there is often multiple people in front, so we just share whoever currently has most control!! if we dont know, just try to not refer to us with a name!)

we collectively identify as a lesboy under the nonbinary umbrella! if this bothers u, pls dni! lesboys r valid!! simple explainaton to enby lesbians -> https://enbysbians.carrd.co/ + simple explanation to lesboys -> https://lesboyguide.carrd.co/ but feel free to ask us about our identities if u are curious! our pronouns.cc is linked if ur curious to our indiviual identities
**^ felt the need to add this while this discourse is trending, WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT "invalidating" LABELS! we love the following: lesboys, turigirls, mspec lesbians and gays, gaybians, and MORE!! WE DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING INVOLVING P3DO, INC3ST OR RACE FETISHIZING! we do NOT fuck with that at all, and if u identify with any label involving those three we will block u asap.  (we of course dont fw other things, but those r the 3 i got off the top of my head ^^ - keira)**

honduran-american, we speak english and spanish, though we struggle writing spanish specifically 

putting this here too incase people dont scroll down, *if we're actively talking in public chat, this means we're feeling fine w/ interacting with people! (unless we only went on it to tell someone to go away) usually we're just in party chat or sitting alone. if we're sitting alone but you want to interact, WHISPER US! **its not a guarentee we'll be in the mood, but if you try to w/o whispering youll just be ignored!***

// note: this github is updated semi-frequently, and this information is likely up to date! last updated 6/22/2025)

*more info about me personally in my strawpage + pronouns.cc!!*

# BEFORE YOU INTERACT !!

we're very cautious of new people, please be considerate about that

we struggle socially due to a mix of a hatred and fear of people

alot of small things make us uncomfortable, pls be mindful!

do not sexualize us/direct sexual jokes at us in any way, we are bodily a minor and have many minors within headspace.

mentally ill (very obvious)

also we r just kinda. stupid in general.

**i quite literally dont care if you think we're sensitive, these are our boundaries that we put in place to help ourselves feel comfortable! if you think its stupid just like.. dont interact w/ us idfk?**

// note: **IF ANYTHING I DO MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, PLEASE TELL ME IMMEDIATELY! MY INTENT IS NEVER TO MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND SOMETIMES I FORGET OR CANT READ TONE!**

# CAUTION *WHEN* INTERACTING !!

if you already are my friend on ponytown, this means we're comfortable enough interacting with you, but you dont know me that well (assuming) so heres just some shit to like. not do when were interacting! this is mainly just jokes we're uncomfortable with, or just some general triggers/media we dont like, since we didnt just want to put it in dni

extremely detailed nsfw jokes, really weird nsfw jokes, or making nsfw jokes directed towards us (unless we've said im fine w/ it) or my friends (literally kys.) //note: (we're fine w/ MILD nsfw jokes, just as long as it isnt detailed/weird)

dont use racial slurs, even if u can reclaim them! we have an extremely bad history with racial slurs, specifcally any against hispanics, and we'd just prefer if you dont! if thats how u joke, its fine (as long as u can reclaim!), just maybe not around us!

no graphic details about s/h, or jokes about it! (we're fine w/ a mention, just no details)

don't mention tdi around us at all. we do not like the media, fandom, or ANYTHING heavily related to it. fans are on thin ice for us i fear

// note: we do not care if u think these are "weird" or that we're overdramatic, most of this shit is because of shit we've gone through that we dont want to me reminded of, thanks! if u dont respect these just dont interact with us!!

# SIMPLE DNI !!

// note: this dni is for ponytown specifically

people who dont respect dni, td/tt, or anything along those lines

people who copy/heavily reference skins (applies to tut skins, ur not rlly learning anything if u just copy and paste imo + seeing like 20 million of the same cosplay makes me evil..)

roleplayers, specifically roleplayers who try to roleplay with random people who dont want to

people who treat me as the character im cosplaying (unless stated otherwise, it is a cosplay! do not treat me like the character, it makes me extremely uncomfortable.)

people who make nsfw avatars (ur weird)

changeling skins,, idk yall just dont respect dni and r so dramamtic when we tell yall to fuck off?? go interact with people who want to.

people who are rude to anyone in my friend group! kys we do not like you!
