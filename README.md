  <p align="center"> hello, we are the overgrown network, we are a system. more info can be found about us in our other websites, which should be linked in our actual bio. <p align="center">


general info to know;

honduran-american ~//~  *bodily a minor, alot of headmates are minors, please do not make sexual jokes around us unless its extremely tame* ~//~ **we collectively identify as a lesboy under the nonbinary umbrella** ~//~ we do not have a collective name. if you are unaware who is fronting, do not refer to us with no name at all, DO NOT CALL US "overgrown network" OR ANYTHING SIMILAR! either use the fronters name or none at all. ~//~ *major memory + mental health issues* ~//~ **chronically online**


**important info;**

we, as a collective, do not trust others. this is because of past and mental issues, and it has caused our brain to think "people = bad", because of this, we are on a strict _dniuid_ (do not interact unless we do), **this includes _any_ form of direct interaction**, such as whispers (yes, even if youre just crowning us), sitting near us, or anything similar. 

if you want to interact with us, whispering and asking is your best bet! it's not a guarrentee we'll be in the mood to interact, but if you randomly come up to us, it is a hard NO.

note; please read our strawpage (which includes a dni) before interacting. im serious, we are very wary about who we talk to, and if you are on our dni (or vise versa), we will *not* interact with you, no exceptions! ~(i also dont wanna hear you say "oh idc if you're on my dni", because **WE** care also. why have a dni if ur not gonna follow it?)~ :sob:
